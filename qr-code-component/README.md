## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

align-items: align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. In Grid Layout, it controls the alignment of items on the Block Axis within their grid area.

align-self: The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.

text-align: text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Place the object in the middle of the page
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still not familiar with the methods of controling the items' position. And I have lots to do to distinguish between different attributes.

### Useful resources

- [google font](https://fonts.google.com/selection/embed) - This helped me for choosing the font style.
